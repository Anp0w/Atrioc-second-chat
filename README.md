# Atrioc-second-chat

Some redditor asked someone to make this, so I decided to do it because I am extremely bored. Someone else has got to host it, I'm too lazy to set it up.

THIS IS EXTREMELY BASIC AND LACKS A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY

Some stuff may break, not work, etc. 
There's probably a lot terrible code here, I don't really remember coding it, nor do I care to double check.
I'm a broke college student living off 1 sandwich and a bag of M&M's per day who is also extremely sleep deprived.

Also CS2 > Valorant and the BMW B58 is the new Toyota 2JZ

For Config.env, replace each placeholder with the actual values (I'm not giving mine up tf?).
The MONGO_URI should point to your MongoDB instance.

Enjoy
